Usage: trupax {options} [volume] [files|folders] {[files|folders] ...}

Options:
-v                   Verbose mode, show all operations in progress.
-r                   Include all sub-directories when searching for files.
--free-space=size    Add given amount of free space to the volume. Size is in
                     bytes, suffixes are k(i), m(i) and g(i). For instance set
                     size to "200m" to add 200,000,000 or set it to "100ki" to
                     add 102,400 bytes of space.
--store-full-path    Store full directory paths down to the root of each file
                     system, expect the root entry (e.g. drive letters).
--write-protect      Mark the container as write-protected.
--label=name         Name of the volume, up to 15 characters long.
--skip-empty-dirs    Don't add directories which are completely empty.
--allow-merge        If name conflicts happen, due to overlapping directories
                     or file structures, then merge the entries by replacing
                     with the rightmost set of the directories declared.
--case-merge         Support file and folder names in a case-sensitive fashion
                     when it comes to potential conflicts while merging.
--overwrite          Overwrite the volume if it already exists. Caution!
--keep-broken-volume Keep the (potentially incomplete) volume file after an
                     error occurred.
--password=password  The password to use, instead of entering manually.
--wipe               Securely erase the original files and folders after the
                     volume has been created successfully.
--wipe-only          Just securely erase objects, do not create a container.
--extract            Extract the given volume to the given location.
--invalidate         Invalidate the given volume. Use with caution!
--for-veracrypt      Create VeraCrypt compatible containers.

Examples: trupax -v -r --label=mytext test.tc mydocs\*.txt diary.txt
          trupax --wipe -r --password=abc123 backup.tc /home/alice/
          trupax -v --free-space=2g photolib.tc "My Pictures\2010"
          trupax -v --extract C:\Users\jane\secure\reports.tc D:\temp
          trupax -v --invalidate /home/bob/Pictures/party.tc
          trupax -r --wipe-only *.tmp index.dat
          trupax -v -r --for-veracrypt "All Documents.hc" ~/Documents
